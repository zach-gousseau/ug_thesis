Topic: Development of a Genetic Algorithm to Solve a Two-Echelon Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows (2E-CVRP-TW)  

Completed under the guidance of Dr. Babak Mehran and Dr. Sharath Narasimhamurthy in the Transportation Systems Research Lab in the Department of Civil Engineering at the University of Manitoba

This project includes three different versions:

* model_1e: Single-echelon case (assuming service station selection by nearest SS node)
* model_1e_ss: Single-echelon case (service station selection included in GA)
* model_2e: Two-echelon case (subject of the thesis)
